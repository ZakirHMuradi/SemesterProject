# UCA Semester Project
# Summary
Determine your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories your body needs to function at rest. You can use a formula or an online calculator to estimate your BMR.
Consider your activity level. Are you sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, very active, or extremely active?
Multiply your BMR by your activity level factor to determine your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). There are different factors for each activity level.
Adjust your calorie intake based on your goals. If you want to lose weight, you will need to create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than your TDEE. If you want to gain weight, you will need to consume more calories than your TDEE. If you want to maintain your weight, you should aim to consume roughly the same number of calories as your TDEE.
Remember, these are just rough estimates, and your actual calorie needs may vary based on factors such as your age, body composition, and genetics. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to determine the best calorie intake for you.

# Calculation Method
To calculate the number of calories you need per day, you can use the following formula:

Determine your basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the number of calories your body needs to function at rest. You can use the following formula to calculate your BMR:
For men: BMR = 66 + (6.2 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) - (6.76 x age in years)

For women: BMR = 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)

Determine your activity level. You can use the following categories to estimate your activity level:
Sedentary: little or no exercise
Lightly active: light exercise 1-3 days/week
Moderately active: moderate exercise 3-5 days/week
Very active: hard exercise 6-7 days/week
Extremely active: very hard exercise and physical job or 2x training
Multiply your BMR by your activity level factor to determine your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). The factors for each activity level are as follows:
Sedentary: BMR x 1.2
Lightly active: BMR x 1.375
Moderately active: BMR x 1.55
Very active: BMR x 1.725
Extremely active: BMR x 1.9
For example, if you are a 30-year-old woman who weighs 150 pounds, is 5'5" tall, and has a sedentary job, your BMR would be: 655 + (4.35 x 150) + (4.7 x 65) - (4.7 x 30) = 1462 calories/day

Your TDEE would then be 1462 x 1.2 = 1754 calories/day.

This is just a rough estimate, and your actual calorie needs may be different depending on a variety of factors such as your age, body composition, and goals. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to determine the best calorie intake for you.
